# Sentiment-Analysis
# Restaurant Review Sentiment Analysis
This project develops a machine learning model to classify restaurant reviews as positive or negative based on text content.

# Overview
The model utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text preprocessing, tokenization, and TF-IDF vectorization. A Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is employed for sentiment classification.

# Key Steps
Dataset: Restaurant reviews with sentiment labels (positive/negative).
Preprocessing: Text cleaning, stopwords removal, and stemming/lemmatization.
Feature Engineering: TF-IDF vectorization for text representation.
Model Building: Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier.
Evaluation: Accuracy and classification metrics.

# Dependencies
pandas, numpy
scikit-learn, nltk
matplotlib, seaborn
wordcloud, contractions
emoji, beautifulsoup4

# Future Work
Explore advanced models (e.g., SVM, LSTM) for potential performance gains.
Fine-tune model hyperparameters for improved accuracy.
Enhance text processing with n-grams for richer context extraction.
